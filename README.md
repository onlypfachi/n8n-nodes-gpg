# n8n-nodes-gpg

This repo contains custom build GPG node for [n8n](n8n.io). It includes the node linter and other dependencies. This node was build with same functionality of the already build PGP node by [Bram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-pgp). However to fix the openPGP bug this node has ```allowInsecureDecryptionWithSigningKeys``` configed. Due to security issues that may be caused by this work around I recommend you first try to use this [node here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-pgp).
